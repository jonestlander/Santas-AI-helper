# Santas AI Helper

Building AI course project
Merry Christmas. Santa needs all the help he can get, and this AI helper will propose the ultimate christmas present for every person on Earth.

## Summary

Finding the optimal present for near and dear ones is very hard before Christmas. By utilizing lists of peoples yearly favourite Christmas presents we train this AI to predict the best present for every person for Christmas. 

## How is it used?

The solution will be in the form of a mobile app, which Santa and whoever is looking for the perfect Chrismas gift, can install. The application is traned with millions of persons favourite christmas gift each year, and at what age they got which present.

Then the user inputs the previous favourite christmas presents for the person to whom they are looking for a present, and the current age of the person.

THe output is the AI-oprimized Christmas presen for that person.

Integration with any of the large online stores or warehouses is optional. Santa of course will not need this, he has his own production facilities in Korvatunturi.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data source to train the AI algorithm will be lists of individual persons favourite christmas gifts at different ages. Santa will have a complete records of this in his big books, which are in the process of being digitalized be all the little tonttus (elves).

The main AI method to use is Logistic Regression
