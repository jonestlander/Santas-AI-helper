# Santas AI Helper

Merry Christmas. Santa needs all the help he can get, and this AI helper will propose the ultimate Christmas present for every person on Earth.
Building AI course project.

## Summary

Finding the optimal present for near and dear ones is very hard before Christmas. By utilizing lists of peoples yearly favourite Christmas presents we train this AI to predict the best present for every person for Christmas. 

## How is it used?

The solution will be in the form of a mobile app, which Santa and whoever is looking for the perfect Chrismas gift, can install. The application is trained with millions of persons favourite Christmas gifts each year, and at what age they got which present.

Then the user inputs the previous favourite Christmas presents for the person to whom they are looking for a new present, and the current age of the person.

The output is the AI-oprimized Christmas present for that person.

Integration with any of the large online stores or warehouses is optional. Santa of course will not need this, he has his own production facilities in Korvatunturi.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data source to train the AI algorithm will be lists of one persons favourite Christmas gifts at different ages. Santa will have the complete records of this in his Big Books, which are in the process of being digitalized be all the little tonttus (elves).

The main AI method to use is Logistic Regression

## Challenges

The largest challenge I see is to somehow quantify the nuerous options for Christmas gifts. Here we might need a list of all possible Christmas gifts, and assign a unique numeral code to each gift.

## What next?

In the future, Santas AI helper could be extended to also cover Birthday presents, gifts for weddings, marriage anniversaries and so on.

One option would also be to include a nauhtyness-niceness parameter in the process, which would affect how optimal the present calculated by Santas AI Helper is for that person.
